# CapriSun Pikachu Bot
This is a Random bot that takes posts from Reddit using the [PRAW](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw), a wrapper for the Reddit API and posts it to Instagram using [Instagrapi](https://github.com/adw0rd/instagrapi), an amazing 3rd party wrapper for the Instagram Private API.
It's Live on [@capri_sun_pikachu_](https://www.instagram.com/capri_sun_pikachu_/)

## Installation
To install the Dependencies, run the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add API keys for Reddit, [the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example). Change The `.env.example` template to   `.env`


`RED_ID` -> Client ID

`RED_SECRET` -> Client Secret

You will also need the **Username** and **Password** of a Instagram Account, since this is an Unofficial API and **In Violation with Instagram's Terms of Service**, proceed with caution. It is Recommended to use an Alt Account.

`USER` -> Username/Phone Number/Email

`RED_SECRET` -> Password

It may also ask you to enter a 6 digit code sent to your email.

## That's It
Yep, this bot has literally no other use :)
